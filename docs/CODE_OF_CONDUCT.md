# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Master Assignment Template is to be inclusive to the largest number of Python instructors and students, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, I am committed to providing friendly, safe and welcoming material for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines my expectations for all those who use, edit, and distribute these educational materials.

I invite all who use, edit, and distribute the materials contained in Master Assignment Template to create safe and positive experience for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

 * Exercise consideration and respect in your use, editing, and distribution of these materials.

 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
