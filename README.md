# Lesson X Programming Assignment

## Objectives
- Formulate a working solution to a business problem that incorporates `<recursion>, <user-defined functions>, <iteration>, <conditionals>`.
- Construct a flowchart that demonstrates the logic of an algorithm.
- Recognize, Identify, Select, Analyze, Differentiate, Distinguish, Diagram, Examine, Outline, Subdivide, Understand, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Represent, Interpret, Evaluate, Apply, Assess, Chart, Construct, Develop, Implement, Prepare, Provide, Compute, Contribute, Determine, Establish, Include, Produce, Show, Combine, Design, Make, Plan, Compose, Create, Devise, Formulate, 

## Directions
- Design a program that `<...>`

- Develop your algorithm before writing any code. Create a flowchart to illustrate your logic.
    - [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a free and easy tool you can use to create flowcharts. 
    - I created an [instructional video](https://youtu.be/oy5nhA7QpNI) outlining how to create and submit flowcharts.
    
- Format the `<user prompt> <output> <file>` as shown in the example below:
  ```
  <format example>
  ```
  
- Test your program by running it several times with different inputs. Verify your algorithm is correct by checking the program output.

- Add the docstring below to the top of your program.
